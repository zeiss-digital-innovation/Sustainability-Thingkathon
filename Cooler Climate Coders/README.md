You need a [HTTP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) providing the files from the `served-files` directory.
You can get one with the following command:

```shell
npm install --global http-server
```
After that, start it from the root directory of the project with the following command:

```shell
http-server served-files -c-1
```
